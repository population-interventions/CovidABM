casesReportedToday:
 - Equal to number of people tracked Case_Reporting_Delay days ago.

tracked:
 - Only applied to infected agents.
 - Tracked agents can cause isolation of the household.
 - Tracked agents are sent to quarantine.
 - Agents become tracked if they are are infected and in an isolated household, need the ICU, or are grabbed by contact tracing.
 - Has something to do with superSpread (TODO, look into this).

asymptomaticFlag:
 - Static parameters drawn from asymptomatic_draw compared to Asymptom_Prop
 - Reduce virulence when passing on infection.
 - Harder to track via contact tracing.

isolating:
 - Set in simul_isolateAndTrackFromHouseHold
 - (isolating = 1) if succeptible and infected household member.
 - (pace = 0) while (isolating = 1) and randomly compliant (set in simul_updateIsolationResponse)
 - isolating only does anything for succeptible agents.
 - An infected agent that is or would isolate gains (tracked = 1) instead.

==== OUTDATED ====
====================================

casesReportedToday:
 - Equal to number of people infected Case_Reporting_Delay days ago.
 - NONE OF THE BELOW MATTERS FOR POLCIY SETTINGS

IDTime:
 - Looks like an output metric.
 - Set to simul.timenow when tracked set to 1, but only via some methods of tracked changing.
 - Looks broken or has an unclear use since it doesn't log all changes to tracked.

asymptomaticFlag:
 - 60% of five-year-olds have (asymptomaticFlag = 1)
 - ((initial_cases * (Asymptom_Prop / 100) * ( Undetected_Proportion / 100 ))) many initial infected agents have (asymptomaticFlag = 1)
 - Changes localInfectiveness in simul_record_patch_infectiveness

tracked:
 - Does something with the link tracking system in assesslinks
 - Non-infected people with no links are not tracked
 - (isolating = 1) infected people have (tracked = 1)
 - (tracked != 1) causes agents to move at speed span
 - (tracked = 1) can let agents move to ICU
 - Does something with SuperSpread
 - Can set (tracked = 1) in simul_traceme, simul_isolateAndTrackHouseHold, simul_hunt
 - Initial cases have (tracked = 1)

track_and_trace_efficiency:
 - Set in traceadjust as a decreasing function of number of infected people.
 - simul_traceme (color = red and track_and_trace_efficiency > random-float 1 and unDetectedFlag = 0) then become (tracked = 1), every step.

isolating:
 - Set in simul_isolateAndTrackHouseHold
 - (pace = 0) while (isolating = 1), this depends on other variables though.
 - Don't move in simul_visitDestination while (isolating = 1)

====================================
==== DELETED ====
====================================

hunted:
 - If the agent has the app (haveApp < App_Uptake) and has a link to them, they become hunted.
 - If they are hunted they become tracked instantly.
 - Seems like a redundant variable.

haveapp:
 - (haveApp <= App_Uptake) means that an agent has the app.
 - Red simulants create links with other simulants at their location, if they both have the app.
 - Out-links from non-red simulants are removed every setp.
 - simul_traceme only sets (tracked = 0) for uninfected agents if they don't have any in-links (why?).
 - Agents can become tracked in simul_hunt if they have in-links.
 - The end result just seems to be that all infected people automatically set (tracked = 1) for everyone they meet over the course of their infection?

asymptom:
 - Random from 0 to 99.
 - Must have (asymptom >= Asymptom_Prop) to get into ICU.
 - Otherwise appears to do nothing.

reported:
 - (unDetectedFlag = 0 and reported = 0) => (reported = 1)
 - Otherwise doesn't appear to do anything at all.

unDetectedFlag:
 - (unDetectedFlag = 0) is required to set (tracked = 1) in simul_traceme.
 - ((initial_cases * (Asymptom_Prop / 100) * ( Undetected_Proportion / 100 ))) many initial infected agents have (unDetectedFlag = 1)
 - simul_assigndetectablestatus sets (unDetectedFlag = 1) if (asymptomaticFlag = 1 and detectable < Undetected_Proportion)
 - In practise, no agent seems to have (unDetectedFlag = 1)
