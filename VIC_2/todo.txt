Add different vaccine infection risk for ages <50 and 50+.
Probably do this with a risk cohort column in population, which then links to a new csv with differing beta distributions.

Output random R0 and other parameters for bucketing.

== Model parameters ==
param_vacIncurMult 0.1 0.5 2.5 12.5
param_policy "ModerateElim" "TightSupress" "LooseSupress"
we set three levels of vaccine coverage for adults (50%, 70% and 90% by 31 December 2021) and both adults and children (50%, 70% and 90% by 30 April 2022), six scenarios in total.

== Missing parameters ==
set reinfect_area rngs:rnd-beta stream_id 10 10

I do not understand what "5.	Prior to opening of borders, a 1% probability of incursion of the virus with same R0 as that selected for post opening was included, with a 20% probability of being vaccinated  (leading to reduced transmission probability, 3 above)." means.
