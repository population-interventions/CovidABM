Add the mixed policy strategy.
Set/check the vaccination time of adults and kids.

Tony/Alex to get hetrogenity of transmissibility.
Tony to redo tracking and tracing equation - DONE
Tim to rerun current at 5.0 and timenow \in [0,4]
VJ correlation of viral load and symptomatic

Calibrate isolation compliance to 75% of single incursions hitting less than 100 cases.
Then calibrate model to find R0 2.5.
Then calibrate stage 4 to slope of -8% on the downhill of 1500 initial cases at R0 2.5.

== Model parameters ==
param_vacIncurMult 0.1 0.5 2.5 12.5
param_policy "ModerateElim" "TightSupress" "LooseSupress"
we set three levels of vaccine coverage for adults (50%, 70% and 90% by 31 December 2021) and both adults and children (50%, 70% and 90% by 30 April 2022), six scenarios in total.

== Missing parameters ==
set reinfect_area rngs:rnd-beta stream_id 10 10

I do not understand what "5. Prior to opening of borders, a 1% probability of incursion of the virus with same R0 as that selected for post opening was included, with a 20% probability of being vaccinated  (leading to reduced transmission probability, 3 above)." means.

Make Non_Infective_Time a distribution???
Asymptomatic multiplier for incursion???
