we set three levels of vaccine coverage for adults (50%, 70% and 90% by 31 December 2021) and both adults and children (50%, 70% and 90% by 30 April 2022), six scenarios in total.

I do not understand what "5. Prior to opening of borders, a 1% probability of incursion of the virus with same R0 as that selected for post opening was included, with a 20% probability of being vaccinated  (leading to reduced transmission probability, 3 above)." means.

Make Non_Infective_Time a distribution???
Asymptomatic multiplier for incursion???
