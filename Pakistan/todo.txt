Aim for R_0 3.7 in stage 1 for calibration.

Speedup:
 * Replace "any? other simuls-here with [ householdUnit != [ householdUnit ] of myself" in general with a "am I at my house" check?
 * simul_visitDestination is particularly slow.
 * SIMUL_AVOID_STUDENT and SIMUL_AVOID are a bit slow.
 * Maybe remove the sliders and inputboxes that have no impact, to reduce the size of output sheets.

Make a document tracking the use of randomness. Overseas incursions currently has a dedicated random stream.


"It sounds like it would make sense to start at 300,000 people vaccinated.  Iâ€™m not sure if you phase vaccination linearly, but in our model we assume that cumulative vaccination by age group will be sigmoidal with respect to time, as there will be some learning by doing in the beginning, and some slowdown as vaccine hesitancy limits the ceiling."
