We only care about:
 - Stage: A list of numbers indicating which stage the model is in on each day.
 - Daily transitions between succeptible/infected/dead/recovered per agent type (age, strata, disabled, atsi etc..)
 - Draw number

These are turned into
 - dead_table: Number of people who go from being alive to being dead per month per age range (per cohort?).
 - dr_table: Number of people who go from being fine to being infected per month per age range (per cohort?), converted into YLD elsewhere.
 - popcost_table: The cost of the transitions per etc.

Four types of files:
 - base disease
 - bau file
 - covid file
 - pif files?
 
 0.42        0.56        0.67

Questions on Monday
 - Mask wearing.
 - Propper data for workers-per-age.
