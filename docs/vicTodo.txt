Worker and student breakdown
Succeptibility multiplier

R0 6, 7, 9

Courtney:
 Age breakdown by 10 year age groups.
 How many people to vaccinate at the start of the model (1st April) and how long ago they had it.
    This is number of people with dose 2/3, when people with dose 2/3 started recieving it.

Hospital length of stay per age (and for ICU too)
Proportion of people who have recovered

Josh (Tony?) to write:
 f: age,variant -> symptomatic chance
 f: age,variant -> hosp chance
 f: age,variant -> icu chance
 f: age,variant -> death chance

Asymptomatic trans estimate
Revisit stage specifications
Static offset in days for hosp, icu, mort - Done
mega isolation if hospitalised - Done
Revisit policy triggers based on hospitatlisations (hosp caculated at time of infection, take length of stay into account)

Mask efficacy of both types (when you hit stage 2, a proportion of worn masks are upgraded).

=== My notes and todo ===
R0 8 may be too low, there are a lot of things driving down transmission.

Todo:
 - Mask input parameters and stage 2 application of mask++
 - Calibration

==================
Drawing outcomes
Masks
Mention vaccination time
Infection time?

length of stay mult in variant

ASK about isolation during calibration.
 - Only Isolate case (check)

Draw proportion of sympt cases that track themselves.
